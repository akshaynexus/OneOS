# iOS 27 (OneiOS)

A system kind of its own in this fork (`akshaynexus/OneOS`, branch `oneios`): Apple's iOS 27 as a OneOS-style
session on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. One UI's framework stops, and instead of another Android framework the session
starts **xnuhost**, OneiOS's source-built XNU running as a process on One UI's kernel, with an iOS image set the
owner built. Volume Up + Volume Down for 3 s brings One UI back, in place when every check holds, else by a
restart. If that ever does nothing, **Power + Volume Down held until the phone restarts** always does: see
"Getting back to One UI".

OneiOS is https://github.com/akshaynexus/OneiOS. Its plan is `docs/plan.md` there; the contract between this fork
and its runtime is `oneos/interface.md` there ("session ABI 1"). This page is the fork's side.

**On the phone so far** (the S24 Ultra, 2026-11-11, 0.4.76 to 0.4.79, runtime 0.1.6): the preflight, the zygote
stop, the watchdog feeder and the in-place return ran, twice to One UI in 45 s. **xnuhost has never started
there**, and one return stood still with a black screen; both causes are found and fixed in 0.4.81 ("What the
first runs on the phone found", below). Everything after xnuhost's start is still unit tests only.

**0.4.86** (115) merges OneOS 0.4.83 to 0.4.85 and the guest wallpaper fix (#133); none of it runs in an iOS
session. It also clears the same two shell traps from OneOS's own Android scripts (a redirected `:`, `tr` reading
`/proc` itself), upstream's new ones included, and the reboot's last resorts no longer wait on each other. Not
yet run on the phone.

## Where its pieces come from

| Piece | Where from | In git or a release? |
|---|---|---|
| OneOS app, `oneios_root.sh`, `oneios_switch.sh`, `oneios_return.sh` | this fork | yes |
| **Runtime**: xnuhost and what it needs to run (OneiOS's own code only) | OneiOS's GitHub releases, asset `oneios-runtime-<version>-arm64.tar.zst` with `<name>.sha256` beside it; the latest release or a tag you name. Or the same file from the phone ("I have the file"), for a build of your own | OneiOS's releases |
| **Image set**: the iOS volumes, the kernel collection with Apple's kexts, the overlay | built by you from Apple's IPSW with OneiOS's scripts, imported from a `.tar.zst` file on the phone | **never**: it is made from Apple's firmware. The app has no download for it |

Both are a zstd-compressed tar with a manifest at the top: `runtime.json` or `manifest.json`, with `format` (1),
`version` and `files` (`path`, `size`, `sha256`; the runtime also `mode`). A runtime also names `session_abi`,
`xnuhost` (its path) and `image_formats` (the image formats it boots). The exact schema is in OneiOS's
`oneos/interface.md`; the image side follows OneiOS's `docs/image-format.md` once that exists.

## Scope: the Galaxy S24 Ultra only

`OneiosSystem.offeredOn` (`core/model/.../Oneios.kt`) is true for one profile, `s-ultra-8650` (SM-S928, e3q,
SM8650), and `oneios_switch.sh` checks the same three properties itself before anything else. On every other
phone there is no iOS card. On the S24 Ultra the card is last in Choose a system, marked Experimental, and the
switch needs a tick every time ("I understand that iOS 27 (OneiOS) is experimental..."), like an untested profile.

It is not an `ImageRef`: it has no Android SDK, no `system.raw`, no package set and no guard jars, so none of the
Android guests' tables, pins or tests know it.

## In the app

Choose a system → **iOS 27 (OneiOS)** → Open (`OneiosActivity`, `OneiosJob`):

- **OneiOS runtime**: what is staged; *Download from OneiOS's releases* (GitHub's API for the latest release or
  a tag, the `.sha256` asset, then the package, checked by size and SHA-256); *I have the file*. With no release
  published it says so in one line and changes nothing.
- **iOS image set**: what is staged; *I have the file* (the system file picker). No download.
- **Session**: *Ready to switch*, or the one line root's preflight gave (for example "no OneiOS runtime is staged:
  xnuhost, the program that runs iOS, comes with it"). How the last session returned.
- *Back to One UI*, shown while a session is still open and the app runs (root's `return` verb starts
  `oneios_return.sh`; with no open session it does nothing).
- The experimental tick and **Switch to iOS 27**, enabled only with the tick and a passing preflight. From
  0.4.80 the switch first stages this build's two session scripts and the boot screen's three files again, so an
  app update reaches the stage without a new import (before, only an import staged them).
- *Remove the iOS files*.
- **Hardware checks**: a screen of its own (`OneiosChecksActivity`), below.
- **Session logs**: a screen of its own (`OneiosLogsActivity`), below.

### Importing either package

The import goes over the road an Android system's image takes (`PrepareJob`): the app unpacks, `RootShell` streams
each file into `su`'s stdin, the root script's `receive` writes it and checks its size and SHA-256, and a
foreground service keeps the app alive. `OneiosImport` (`:core:root`) runs it; the parts both systems use are
shared, not copied:

| Part | Android system (`PrepareJob`) | iOS package (`OneiosJob`, `OneiosImport`) |
|---|---|---|
| Unpacking | in the app, `GZIPInputStream` | in the app, zstd-jni's `ZstdInputStream` (window up to 2^27) |
| To root | `RootShell.Feed` into `oneos_root.sh receive` | the same `RootShell.Feed` into `oneios_root.sh receive` |
| Check | the app hashes while it sends; root hashes the file it wrote and refuses a mismatch | the same |
| Progress | `ByteMeter`: the screen hears of the bytes every 250 ms, with the time left | the same `ByteMeter`, also the speed |
| Kept alive by | `PrepareService` (`KeepAliveService`) | `OneiosService` (`KeepAliveService`), which also holds a CPU wakelock while the copy runs |

What the iOS import does on top, because a package is 21 files and about 18 GB behind one zstd stream:

- **One pass.** OneiOS packs `manifest.json` (and `runtime.json`) as the archive's first file. The app reads it
  from there (`OneiosPackage.manifestFirst`), checks it (`OneiosManifests.parse`: format version, plain relative
  paths, sizes, SHA-256s, no duplicates; a runtime must name an xnuhost that is one of its files with mode 0755)
  and goes on in the same stream. A package whose manifest is not first is read twice, as before 0.4.78: once to
  find the manifest, once to unpack.
- **Three threads for a file.** One reads ahead through the decompressor (`ReadAhead`, 4 MiB buffers), one
  writes to root's stdin in 4 MiB writes, one hashes the buffer being written (`HashedCopy`). Before 0.4.78 one
  thread did all three in turn, 1 MiB at a time.
- **Root's check of a large file runs while the next file is sent.** `receive` hashes the file it wrote by
  reading it again. For a file of 64 MiB or more the app starts the next `receive` meanwhile and takes root's
  answer before the file after that is done, and before `finish`. Smaller files are answered one at a time.
- **`receive` copies with `dd` in 1 MiB blocks** (`copy_bytes` in `oneios_root.sh`): toybox's `head -c` copies
  4 KiB at a time. It uses `iflag=count_bytes,fullblock` (GNU, busybox) or `iflag=count_bytes` (toybox, which
  counts the bytes it read and refuses `fullblock`), found by copying two bytes of three; a `dd` that does
  neither leaves `head -c`.
- **`finish` runs `sync` once** before it puts the new runtime or image in place.

What holds as before: a member the manifest does not list, a wrong size, a wrong SHA-256, a missing file, a
link or a device ends the import. Root refuses a file whose size or SHA-256 is not what `receive` was told and
removes its `.part`. Files land in `<kind>.new`, and only `finish`, which is asked for after root has answered
OK for every file, puts the new runtime or image in place of the old one. A failed import leaves what was staged
before untouched.

The screen during an import: the file being sent (`File 3 of 21: os.img (10.6 GB)`), a bar, and
`3.2 GB of 17.9 GB (18%) · 412 MB/s · about 2 min left`. The rows are built again only when the step or the
file changes; the byte count moves the bar and that line. Before 0.4.78 the job sent a state for every MiB (a few
hundred a second) and the screen built all its rows again for each: that was the lag. The screen stays on while a
download or an import runs (`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`), and with the screen off or the app in the background
`OneiosService` keeps it going; its notification shows the same line. *Stop* ends it.

#### Measuring the import

`OneiosImportBench` (`:core:root` tests) times the stages and the whole import on a PC against the root script
and a fake root folder. It needs a synthetic package (random and repeated bytes, `manifest.json` first; never
Apple's files) and runs only when asked:

```
ONEIOS_BENCH_PACKAGE=<synthetic .tar.zst> ONEIOS_BENCH_DIR=<folder on a disk> \
  [ONEIOS_BENCH_OLD_SCRIPT=<oneios_root.sh of 0.4.76>] \
  ./gradlew :core:root:testDebugUnitTest --rerun --tests '*OneiosImportBench*'
```

On the development PC (x86-64, NVMe, bash and GNU tools), a 4.0 GiB set of 21 files packed like the real one
(`zstd -10 --long=27`, 2.35 GiB):

| | 0.4.76 | 0.4.78 |
|---|---|---|
| The whole import | 242 MB/s (17.7 s) | 577 MB/s (7.4 s); 474 MB/s in another run |
| Screen updates sent | 4079 (about 230 a second) | 26 (about 4 a second) |
| Root's `receive` alone, 1 GiB: the write | 1.58 s (`head -c`); 1.25 s in another run | 1.05 s (`dd bs=1M`) |
| Root's `receive` alone, 1 GiB: the SHA-256 after it | 1.18 s | 1.15 s, now beside the next file |

The stages alone there: zstd 1400 to 1600 MB/s, SHA-256 in the JVM 990 MB/s, zstd with tar and SHA-256 on one
thread 660 MB/s. Without the app's own SHA-256 the whole import was 580 MB/s (507 in the other run), within the
spread between runs, so that hash stays as the second check. **None of
this has been measured on the phone**: its `dd`, `head` and `sha256sum` are toybox's, its storage and cores are
others, and the `iflag=count_bytes` branch of `copy_bytes` runs in the tests only behind a stand-in.

## Hardware checks

iOS 27 (OneiOS) → **Hardware checks**: OneiOS's own phone tools, run as root **while One UI keeps running**, one row
per check. They come in the runtime package (`bin/bridgectl`, `gpuctl`, `displayctl`, `brightctl`, `camctl`; OneiOS
release `v0.1.0` is the first that has them all), so the screen uses the staged runtime; with none staged it shows
*Download from OneiOS's releases* first (the latest release, the same download as on the iOS screen).
**None of the tools has run on the phone yet**: the first Run all is their first run.

| Row | Command (in `runtime/bin`) | Limit | Said before it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU layout | `bridgectl cpu` | 15 s | |
| GPU | `gpuctl` (Adreno through drm2kgsl and udmabuf; from runtime 0.1.5 all its steps: nodes, routes, probe, submit, large) | 120 s | |
| Display layer | `displayctl test` | 30 s | colour bars over the whole screen for 5 s |
| Haptics | `bridgectl haptic 200 1000` | 10 s | the phone buzzes once |
| Haptics pattern | `bridgectl haptic-pattern` | 15 s | three taps, then a ramp |
| Audio | `bridgectl audio <bin>/oneios-audio` | 20 s | a 440 Hz tone for 2 s |
| Bluetooth | `bridgectl bt` | 45 s | Bluetooth has to be off in One UI |
| Brightness | `brightctl info` | 10 s | |
| Brightness steps | `brightctl levels` | 30 s | adaptive brightness has to be off; the screen steps dim to full for 12 s |
| Light sensor | `brightctl als 10` | 25 s | cover the back, then point it at a light |
| Cameras | `camctl --backend ndk list` | 30 s | |
| Camera | `camctl --backend ndk --camera wide --frames 90 --out <checks>/camera.png capture` | 45 s | the camera is used briefly; close the Camera app |
| Cameras by the HAL (experimental) | `camctl --backend hal list` | 30 s | |
| Camera by the HAL (experimental) | `camctl -v --backend hal --camera wide --frames 90 --out <checks>/camera-hal.png capture` | 45 s | Samsung's HAL opened directly, never tried |

- **Run all** (the button at the bottom) runs the twelve ordinary rows in this order, after one dialog that lists
  what the owner will see, hear and has to do. The two HAL rows are not part of it. **Run** on a row runs that one;
  a row with something to say asks first.
- The app reads two settings itself: with Bluetooth on, the Bluetooth row is not run, and with adaptive brightness
  on, Brightness steps is not run. In Run all they are marked **Skipped** with the reason; a single Run says so and
  starts nothing.
- A row shows **Pass**, **Fail** or **Skipped** and one line: the tool's last line, or what the tool found (the CPU
  plan, the panel's node and range, frames and frame rate). Tapping the row opens the details: the command, the
  full output (the tool's stdout and stderr, selectable), and for the camera rows the PNG the tool wrote. **Copy**
  and **Share** there take that check's log; **Share all** and **Copy all** take every check's log as one text,
  headed by the app version, the runtime version, the phone and the time. A shared text is cut at 200,000 characters.
- **Skipped** also means: the tool is not in the staged runtime ("Not in this runtime: bin/camctl"), the owner
  pressed Stop, or root refused (an open session).
- **Stop** ends the running tool and leaves the rest of the queue as Skipped.

How a check runs. `oneios_root.sh check <id>` (the app's usual launcher; the id is one of the table's, nothing
else is taken): refuses during an iOS session, without a staged runtime, and when One UI is not fully up; runs only
the file whose SHA-256 root recorded when the runtime was staged; starts it with no stdin and `TMPDIR` in
`<stage>/checks`; prints its output and `exit <code>`, `timeout <seconds>` or `missing <tool>`. The app
(`OneiosChecks.classify`, `core/model`) reads the verdict from the exit code **and** the tool's lines:
`ok`/`failed` for bridgectl, `ok`/`FAILED at: ...` for gpuctl, `displayctl: ok`, `brightctl: ok` (plus a `panel:`
line that names a device, a `restored` line), `back end: ndk, N cameras` with N above 0, and for a capture frames
read, a written PNG and a picture that is not black. The failure lines of camctl's README
(`status -10013`, `hal: no service`, `exception -8, camera status 2`, `configureStreams ... status 1`,
`no frame arrived`, `(black`) each add a line that says what it means.

**Time limits.** Root's: at the row's limit the tool gets SIGTERM (bridgectl, brightctl and displayctl put back
what they changed on it), 2 s later SIGKILL, only if the pid is still that tool. The row then fails with
"Ended after N s". The app's: 20 s after root's limit it ends the root command itself and runs `uncheck <id>`.

**What is put back** after a tool was ended (by root's limit, by Stop, or by `uncheck <id>`): the tool and its
helpers are killed (only processes whose command line is a file of `<stage>/runtime/bin`, and the display test's
`OneiOSDisplay` layer process); the backlight is written back to the level read before `brightctl levels` ran; the
light sensor's `enable` file gets the value it had before `brightctl` ran; the display test's socket folder is
removed. A tool that ends by itself has done this itself (each README's "restore").

**What the checks never do** (`OneiosScriptTest.theChecksLeaveOneUiAlone`, on the script's text): set a property,
stop or start a service or zygote, run a session script, enter another namespace, mount, reboot, or write outside
`<stage>/checks`, except those two put-back writes under `/sys/class/backlight` and `/sys/class/input`. The camera
check's picture stays on the phone: in `<stage>/checks` and, for the details view, in the app's cache; Share sends
text only.

## Session logs

iOS 27 (OneiOS) → **Session logs** (`OneiosLogsActivity`, `OneiosLogActivity`, `OneiosLogsJob`): what the iOS
sessions left in the stage, read as root after the return. **Not run on the phone yet.**

- **Sessions**: *Last session* (or *This session (still open)*) is `session/xnuhost.log`; up to five *Earlier
  session* rows are `logs/xnuhost-<epoch>.log`, newest first. Each row has the time of the log's last line, its
  size, and how it ended, read from its last 40 lines (`exit 4 · kernel panic`, `exit 0 · stopped by SIGTERM`; with
  no end line, the log's last line).
- **The switch, the return and the helpers**: `switch.log`, `return.log` (the return's steps, the watcher's and the
  key readers' lines), `control/display.log`, `control/watchdog_feeder.log`, each when it exists.
- **A row opens the log.** Its last 256 KiB are read and shown first, scrolled to the end; earlier chunks of 1 MiB
  follow by themselves until 4 MiB are read or the log is whole, and *Load earlier lines* above the first line reads
  4 MiB more (the viewer holds 250,000 lines at most). The search field and the chips **E** (xnuhost's error
  lines), **!!** (lines from signal context), **panic** (the word by itself, not `-no_slto_panic` of the boot
  arguments) and **guest** (the kernel's console) narrow what is shown: chips add up, the search narrows further.
  A long press copies a line. **Copy** takes the lines shown, with the summary first (the last 200,000
  characters). **Share** reads the whole log again and hands it over as a file, the summary in the message's text.
- **Share all as a zip**: every listed log, whole (a log past 32 MiB keeps its last 32 MiB and says so), at its
  path in the stage, plus `summary.txt` with the app, the phone, and each session's summary. The files are made
  under `files/logs/oneios-session`, which the app's file provider serves to the app chosen in the share sheet.
- **What is shared here is the log as it is on the phone**, not redacted: an xnuhost log is the kernel's console
  and xnuhost's own lines. *Collect logs* (Last session) is the way that removes personal data; from 0.4.76 it
  takes these files too (below).

**The summary** above an xnuhost log (`OneiosLogs.summarize`, `core/model`):

| Line | From |
|---|---|
| Boot got to | the furthest of nine stages seen, in this order: `xnuhost I xnuhost: session ABI` (xnuhost started); `xnuhost I cpu0: entering the kernel at`; the console's `Darwin Kernel Version` (kernel start); `BSD root: ` (root mount); `load_init_program: attempting to load` (launchd loading); the first `com.apple.xpc.launchd\|` line (launchd running); the first console line with `backboardd[`; the first with `SpringBoard[` or `crashed: SpringBoard.`; `xnuhost I guest ready: first frame` (xnuhost writes `session/ready` with it). A stage before the furthest that was never seen is named |
| Kernel panic | the text after `panic(cpu N caller 0x...): ` of the console, the first of the last boot that panicked |
| Processes that died | the console's `sheng-exit: NAME[PID] status 0x.. reason ns .. code 0x..` (the signal is the status's low 7 bits), `Process[PID] crashed: NAME.` and `[NAME: killed] exiting with signal N`, counted once per process: by name, with the count and the signals |
| Ended | xnuhost's `stopping: WHY (reason R, code C)` (`signal 15` is the return's SIGTERM; `the guest halted on cpuN` with reason 2 a panic, 0 a shutdown, 3 a return asked by the guest; `PSCI SYSTEM_OFF`; `kernel fault`), its `exit N` with the meaning of OneiOS's exit code table, `xnuhost !! fault inside a host call` or `fault on a host thread` (a crash of xnuhost itself, with the signal), a log that ends before the kernel was entered (setup; the last error line), or no end line at all (killed, a restart of the phone, or still running). Then, from `return.log`, the return that started within two minutes of the log's last line: who started it (the watcher with its reason such as `return asked (keys: Volume Up + Volume Down down for 3 s ...)`, `xnuhost N ended`, `the guest did not report ready within 600s`; the app; the key readers; by hand) and how it came out (`One UI restored in place`, `FAILSAFE: ...`) |
| Counts | lines, xnuhost error lines, lines from signal context, in-place restarts of the guest; and a note while only the end of the log has been read |

The markers are the lines xnuhost's sources print (`runtime/xnuhost/src/main.c`, `log.c`, `cpu.c` in OneiOS, its
`docs/booter.md`) and the lines the kernel printed in OneiOS's boots on the PC (`logs/fb-boot.log`,
`logs/keystore-boot*.log`); OneiOS's `oneos/interface.md` section 8 lists them as what the fork reads. The
`backboardd` and `SpringBoard` stages go by the first console line that names the process with its pid, which is
what those logs have; a boot whose console never names them is shown as stopping at launchd.

How it is read. `oneios_root.sh logs` prints, for each log that exists, `@@RESULT log <id> <bytes> <mtime>` and its
last 40 lines (each cut at 400 characters) as `| <id> <line>`; ids are `session`, `xnuhost-<epoch>` (the five
newest), `switch`, `return`, `display`, `feeder`. `logfile <id> <end> <bytes>` prints `@@RESULT chunk <id> <size>
<start> <end>` and the bytes `[start, end)` as `| <line>`: at most 1 MiB a call, `end` 0 being the file's end, and
whole lines only (a chunk that does not start the file starts after its first line break, and the next call ends
there). Both verbs **only read**: no file is made, changed or moved, each read of a file runs under `timeout 20`,
and the app ends a root command that has not answered in 45 s. `session/` is the guest's to write, so a log is
read only when it is a plain file with one name in a folder that is no link. The launcher runs only this build's
root script: on a stage that holds an earlier build's, the screen's first read runs `status` once, which puts this
build's script there.

**Collect logs** (`assets/logs/collect.list`, entry `logs.oneios`, from 0.4.76): the same files (and
`return.outcome`) from `/data/local/tmp/oneios` go into the bundle's `oneios/` folder, through the same runner,
the same read-only audit (`ProbeAudit`) and the same redaction as every other entry (the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
names learned first, the masks of `Redactor`). A file past 64 MiB is skipped with a note, as for every `files`
entry.

## Stage

`/data/local/tmp/oneios`, root:root, mode 0700. It is not the Android guests' stage (`/data/local/tmp/oneos`),
and neither kind of session starts while the other's stage has anything mounted.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `bin/oneios_root.sh` | the app's root script; the launcher runs it only with the SHA-256 pinned in BuildConfig |
| `oneios_switch.sh`, `oneios_return.sh` | the session scripts, pinned the same way, staged with every import and before every switch |
| `bin/boot_status.sh`, `bin/OneOSBootStatus.dex`, `bin/oneos_boot_icon.png` | OneOS's boot screen (below), the same three files an Android guest's stage holds, pinned and staged like the session scripts |
| `runtime/`, `runtime.conf`, `runtime.sha256`, `runtime.ids` | the unpacked runtime; its version, session ABI, xnuhost path and image formats; every file's SHA-256; every file's `dev:inode:size:mtime` |
| `image/`, `image.conf`, `image.sha256`, `image.ids` | the same for the image set |
| `data/` | iOS's own writable state. A new runtime or image keeps it; Remove deletes it |
| `session/` | what xnuhost and the switch share in the running or last session: `xnuhost.log`, `xnuhost.pid`, `ready`, `return.request`, `display.sock`, `tmp/` |
| `control/` | the way back's own: the session's state, the baseline, xnuhost's pid and namespace as the switch recorded them, the watcher's and key readers' pids, the return's lock and guard; `bootui/` (the boot screen's status files and pids) and `bootui.log` (the switch's lines about it). Read-only in xnuhost's namespace, like the two session scripts and `bin/` |
| `logs/` | the five sessions before the last: `xnuhost-<epoch>.log`, moved there by the next switch (the epoch is that switch's time; the file's own time is its session's last line) |
| `checks/` | the hardware checks' own: each check's last output (`<id>.log`), the camera pictures (`camera.png`, `camera-hal.png`), the values to put back (`saved.backlight`, `saved.als`), the tools' temporary files |
| `switch.log`, `return.log`, `return.outcome` | the switch's output; the return's, the watcher's and the key readers'; how the last return ended. `control/display.log` and `control/watchdog_feeder.log` are the display helper's and the watchdog feeder's |

## Session flow

`oneios_root.sh switch` runs the preflight (`oneios_switch.sh --check`) and returns its refusal to the app as one
line. Only when it passes does it start `oneios_switch.sh`, detached, in init's mount namespace.

**Preflight, before any change.** Root; the S24 Ultra; the stage and both session scripts root's own; a runtime
whose session ABI is this build's, with an xnuhost that is root's, executable and an arm64 ELF; every runtime
file's SHA-256 again; an image set of a format the runtime boots, every file the one root hashed at staging
(files under 64 MiB are hashed again; `ONEIOS_VERIFY_IMAGE=1` hashes all); nothing in either folder that its list
does not name; the root manager's busybox and resetprop; init's mount namespace; One UI fully up; no session of
either kind open; the volume keys readable; battery at 30 % or charging and not hot; 2 GiB free; the tick. Any
failure prints `PREFLIGHT REFUSED: <reason>` and exits: nothing was changed, One UI keeps running. **Until a
runtime with xnuhost is staged, this is where every switch ends.**

**Then:**

1. Session folder, control folder and baseline: boot id, SELinux mode, properties, the pids of vold, keystore2,
   surfaceflinger and servicemanager, init's mount points.
2. The way back is armed first, each part in a session of its own (`setsid`) in init's mount namespace: the
   watcher, a `getevent` reader per volume-key device, and a poll of the keys' state. A kernel wakelock
   (`oneios_session`) keeps the phone awake without One UI's power manager. **One UI is not stopped unless all
   of them run and the wakelock is held**; if not, the switch ends there.
3. The boot screen starts (below), then One UI's zygote and zygote_secondary are stopped, so system_server and
   every app end; a loop keeps them stopped. surfaceflinger, the vendor composer, audioserver, netd, vold, keystore2 and the radio keep running.
   Samsung's software watchdog gets its magic close and a feeder, as in an Android session.
4. xnuhost starts in a **new mount namespace** in which the stage is bound over `/data`; `runtime`, `image`,
   `control`, `bin` and the two session scripts are read-only there. It gets a cgroup of its own
   (`/sys/fs/cgroup/oneios_session`) and `oom_score_adj` 500, so that it, not One UI's daemons or the way back,
   is what the kernel ends when memory runs out:
   `/data/runtime/<xnuhost> --session-abi 1 --mode takeover --runtime /data/runtime --image /data/image --data /data/data --session /data/session`.
   If One UI's `/data` is still visible there, or `control` is writable there, it does not start.
   From 0.4.81 the shell that sets this namespace up writes a line to `session/xnuhost.log` before each step
   (`oneios inner: 08:12:21 making /data/runtime read-only`), and however it ends before xnuhost starts, its last
   line is `oneios inner: ... ended with status N in step: ...`. The switch waits for it by its progress: until
   it wrote xnuhost's pid, for as long as that shell runs (`control/inner.pid`), 30 s at most; a shell that ended
   is not waited for. A shell still setting up when a return begins is ended by its pid, and it starts nothing if
   the switch's state is no longer `starting`.
5. The watcher returns to One UI when xnuhost ends, when `session/return.request` appears (the volume keys write
   it; xnuhost does when the guest asks; `adb` can), or when xnuhost has not created `session/ready` within
   600 s of its start (`ONEIOS_RETURN_MAX`; iOS never came up).

**Return** (`oneios_return.sh`), five steps, each logged to `return.log`:

1. **The session ends.** SIGTERM to xnuhost, 20 s; then everything that is left is killed: the cgroup at once
   (`cgroup.kill`), every process in xnuhost's mount namespace, and every process outside init's namespace whose
   mount table still shows the stage. The key readers and the watcher end. The boot screen, where it is still
   up, says "Returning to One UI" during this step and is ended at its end, before the first gate.
2. **Gate A.** No such process is left; the stage is mounted in no process's mount table (every namespace, not
   only init's: OneOS's run 45); nothing was mounted on One UI's partitions; the same boot; vold, keystore2 and
   servicemanager have their pids of the switch; the daemons One UI cannot restart are running; SELinux is as
   it was. Persist properties that differ from the switch are logged by name (the scripts set none).
3. **Gate B: display and services.** The stop loop is gone; One UI's boot-loop counters go back to the switch's
   (in memory). Then the display, as in OneOS's return: **the vendor composer is restarted, surfaceflinger with
   it** (restarted by name if it outlived the composer, started if it had died), and the boot animation starts.
   Then audioserver and the rest of zygote's restart list (cameraserver, media, wificond, and perfmond and
   media.tuner if they ran). Each must come back and register.
4. **One UI's framework.** `vdc volume abort_fuse`, a fresh zygote_next, `ctl.restart netd` (whose own restart
   list starts zygote; `ctl.start zygote` otherwise).
5. **Gate C.** system_server keeps its pid until user 0 is unlocked and 20 s more, within 180 s.

**Every step has a time limit of its own** (0.4.81), kept by the return's guard, a process of its own: 90 s to
stop the session, 45 s for Gate A, **75 s for Gate B**, 45 s to start One UI's zygote, 290 s for Gate C (its
waits are 60 s, 180 s and 20 s). A step that stands still, on a command that never comes back, is rebooted out
of at its limit (`GUARD: '[3/5] Gate B: ...' did not finish within 75s`), not after the guard's 600 s for the
whole return. Gate B's waits for a service to register are by the clock (a `service check` that does not answer
takes 3 s each time).

A failed check anywhere is the failsafe: `sys.powerctl reboot,oneios-inplace-failsafe`, then Android's own
`reboot`, then busybox's `reboot -f`, then sysrq. None of them waits on the one before: Android's `reboot` (which
waits for init once it set the property) runs in the background, and each `sync` is given 5 s at most. Busybox needs no reboot applet: KernelSU's has none, and from
0.4.77 the switch no longer asks for one (`oneos_switch.sh` never did). In the session's mount namespace the stage is bound over `/data`, which hides the root manager's busybox
(`/data/adb`): from 0.4.79 the namespace's setup runs a copy in `control/busybox` (as `guest_prepare.sh` copies
busybox into an Android guest's `/data`). `oneios_return.sh reboot` goes straight there. A return with no open session does
nothing, and a switch that ended before it stopped One UI's zygote (the stop is marked in `control/stopped`)
only has its helpers ended: neither restarts anything.

## Boot screen

From the stop of One UI's framework until iOS draws, the screen shows **OneOS's own boot screen**, the one a
switch to an Android guest shows. Before 0.4.80 it went black there, and since iOS does not draw a frame yet, a
session looked like black and then One UI again, as if the phone had restarted. **Not run on the phone yet.**

What is reused, not written again (`docs/boot-status.md`):

| Piece | For an Android guest | For iOS |
|---|---|---|
| `boot_status.sh`: the status files (`title`, `status`, `verbose`, `generation`, `ready`, `stop`), the supervisor that restarts the renderer when surfaceflinger changes | `oneos_boot_begin enter` / `restart` / `return`, status directory `<Android stage>/data/oneos_bootui` | `oneos_boot_begin ios`, status directory `control/bootui`, the files from the stage's `bin/` (`ONEOS_BOOT_HOME`) |
| `OneOSBootStatus.dex` (`switcher/patches/OneOSBootStatus.java`): a root `app_process` that draws on a SurfaceControl BLAST layer at z 2,000,000,000 | icon, title, and the status line with Verbose boot on | the same, with the status line always on and a `hint` file drawn near the bottom edge (status and hint wrap) |
| `oneos_boot_icon.png` | the OneOS icon | the same icon. **No Apple logo, name or mark is drawn**: the title is the text "Starting iOS 27" |
| Where the status comes from | Android's boot events (`logcat -b events`) and the scripts' `ctl.start` / `ctl.stop` | the switch's feeder (`oneios_switch.sh --bootui`), from `session/xnuhost.log`; the supervisor's `ios` mode reads no Android event and does not wait for a boot animation |
| How it ends | the new framework's display-ready event or its boot animation's end; at most 600 s | the stop flag: at the hand-off, at the return, or after 1800 s |

**What it shows.** The OneOS icon; the title **Starting iOS 27**; one status line; and near the bottom edge
**Hold Volume Up + Volume Down for 3 s to go back to One UI**. The status line:

| When | Status |
|---|---|
| the screen is up, One UI's zygote is being stopped | Stopping One UI's framework |
| step 4 begins | Starting xnuhost |
| `xnuhost I xnuhost: session ABI` | xnuhost is loading the kernel |
| `xnuhost I cpu0: entering the kernel at` | Entering the kernel |
| console `Darwin Kernel Version` | Kernel started |
| console `BSD root: ` | Root volume mounted |
| console `OneiOS Data: first start` or `OneiOS Data: unpacking the seed` | Data volume: first start (this can take a few minutes) |
| console `load_init_program: attempting to load` | Loading launchd |
| console `com.apple.xpc.launchd\|` | launchd is running |
| the first console line with `backboardd[` | backboardd started |
| the first with `SpringBoard[` or `crashed: SpringBoard.` | SpringBoard started |
| `xnuhost I guest ready: first frame` | iOS is up: waiting for its first frame |
| console `panic(cpu N caller 0x...): TEXT` | Kernel panic: TEXT |
| xnuhost ended | iOS stopped: kernel panic: TEXT; or iOS stopped: WHY (xnuhost exit N), from `stopping: WHY` and `exit N`; or xnuhost ended with exit N; or xnuhost ended: its last `xnuhost E` line |
| xnuhost never started | xnuhost did not start: the log's last line |
| the watcher returns | the title becomes **Returning to One UI**; the status is the reason above, or "A return to One UI was asked for", "iOS did not start within 60 s", "iOS did not come up within 600 s" |
| a return from the app, by hand or from the key readers | **Returning to One UI**, Stopping iOS |

The stage markers are the Session logs screen's nine (`OneiosLogs.kt`, above), with the kernel's two `OneiOS
Data:` lines between the root mount and launchd (a new Data volume is made and its seed unpacked there, which
takes minutes with nothing else to see). The furthest stage seen is shown; when xnuhost starts the guest again in
place, the stages start again. The feeder looks once a second at what the log gained (at most 1 MiB a look). The
log is the guest's to write, so what is drawn from it is cut to 200 characters of printable ASCII.

**The hand-off.** The display helper's layer is above the boot screen's (z 2,147,483,646 against 2,000,000,000)
and opaque. So when the helper posts the guest's first frame, that picture covers the boot screen, and the
feeder then stops the boot screen under it: it sees `oneios-display: first frame posted` in
`control/display.log` with the helper still running, or `session/ready` with the helper running and its
`oneios-display: layer up`. This is how OneOS hands its boot screen to a guest's compositor: the new picture
first, then the stop flag, and the renderer takes its own layer away. **While iOS shows nothing, the boot screen
stays**: `ready` without a running helper leaves it up ("iOS is up: waiting for its first frame"), because
taking it away would leave a black screen with no way back written on it. It is not brought back if the helper
ends later.

**The size.** The renderer draws for the logical size One UI's display manager gave it (1080 x 2340 with One
UI's resolution set to FHD+). The display helper, when it connects in a takeover, sets the display's projection
to the panel's own mode and leaves it so. The feeder sees its `oneios-display: display projection set to the
active mode` and writes `native` to the status directory; the renderer then draws for the active mode's size.

**The return** ends it on every path. `oneios_return.sh` writes the title, and at the end of its first step
(before Gate A, and before the branch for a switch that never stopped One UI) sets the stop flag and a new
generation, which retire the supervisor, the renderer (it removes its layer) and the feeder; the feeder is
killed at once, the other two after a second if they are still there, each by its pid and only while that pid is
still the same program. The same happens before every reboot the return asks for (the failsafe, the guard, the
reboot return); the watcher's own reboot sets the stop flag. The three processes are One UI-side: init's mount
namespace, the root cgroup, never the session's, so the gates do not count them, and a renderer that could not
be ended is logged and nothing more: Gate B restarts the composer and surfaceflinger, which drops every layer.

**Optional, like OneOS's** ("every failure leaves the original boot/return path intact"). The screen starts only
after the way back is armed and checked. If one of the three files is not staged or not root's, if there is no
`app_process`, or if the renderer posts no frame, the switch goes on exactly as before 0.4.80 (the renderer gets
3 s before One UI is stopped, and is given up after 30 s without a frame). Nothing of the watcher, the key
readers, the poll or the gates reads anything of the boot screen's. It opens no input device (`getevent` stays
the only reader of the keys, and it does not grab), sets no property, holds no wakelock and stops no service.
`ONEIOS_BOOTUI=0` (over adb) turns it off.

## What the first runs on the phone found

Three switches on the S24 Ultra on 2026-11-11 (07:24 with 0.4.76, 07:38 and 08:12 with 0.4.79), each ending
`!!! xnuhost did not start`. The evidence: `switch.log`, `return.log`, the stage's listing, and the kernel log of
the boot that was force-restarted (`/proc/last_kmsg`).

**1. xnuhost never started, and from 0.4.79 the inner shell said nothing.** The shell that sets up xnuhost's
namespace checked that `control/` is read-only there with `if : 2>/dev/null > /data/control/.w; then`. `:` is a
*special builtin*, and Android's `sh` (mksh R59) ends the whole script when the redirection of a special builtin
fails; with `2>/dev/null` before it, without a word, with status 1. So the check ended the shell exactly when it
succeeded. On the phone: `sh -c 'if : 2>/dev/null > /proc/nonexistent/.w; then echo writable; fi; echo survived'`
prints nothing and returns 1 (bash prints `survived`, which is why the PC's tests under bash never saw it, and
the tests under mksh never ran this branch: it is behind the session). It fits the stage: `control/busybox` was
copied at 08:12 (the step before the binds), no `session/xnuhost.pid`, an empty log, and no process left for the
return to kill (the shell had exited, its namespace with it). In 0.4.76 the shell never got that far (busybox was
hidden by the bind, fixed in 0.4.79). The 10 s wait was not too short: the shell was gone within a second.
Reproduced on the PC with 0.4.79's script under mksh in a user and mount namespace: the same end. Fixed: no script redirects `:` any more (`true` is not a special builtin), in `oneios_switch.sh`,
`oneios_return.sh` and `oneios_root.sh`; the trace and the wait by progress above.

**2. The return of 08:12 stood still at Gate B** (`=== [3/5] Gate B ===` at 08:12:34, then nothing; a black
screen until the owner's forced restart at 08:21). The kernel log shows init received no `ctl.restart` for the
composer (its last control message is the switch's), and a process `tr` with pid 32734, 134 pids after the
return's own 32600, **on a CPU** at 428 s, 516 s, 581 s and 593 s of uptime (the return began at 330 s). Gate B
begins by waiting for the stop loop to end, asking each time whether its pid is still that script:
`tr '\0' ' ' < /proc/PID/cmdline`. The stop loop ended in that moment (it had just been told to). A read of
`/proc/PID/cmdline` whose process ended after the open fails with ESRCH, and **toybox 0.8.13's `tr` reads again
for ever when a read fails**. On the phone, with a 3 s limit: `tr a b < /system` (EISDIR) and `tr` on the open
cmdline of a `sleep` that ended both run into the limit (exit 124); `cat` ends with the error. It is a race, so
the returns of 07:25 and 07:39 passed. Fixed: `cat PID/cmdline | tr` everywhere a cmdline is read (the return,
the switch, and OneOS's `boot_status.sh`), so the read error ends `cat` and `tr` sees the end of a pipe; and the
step limits above, so that anything else that stands still in Gate B is a reboot after 75 s, not a black phone
for ten minutes.

Also in that log, not this fork's doing but worth knowing: the phone's reset history
(`/data/log/power_off_reset_reason.txt`) has two kernel panics between the sessions, at 07:49 and 08:02
(`_raw_spin_trylock`, `usercopy_abort`), with One UI running and no session open.

## Getting back to One UI

The way back is entirely on One UI's side. Nothing in it needs the guest to cooperate, to be responsive, or to
have started at all. From the fastest to the one that cannot fail:

| # | What | Works when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Volume Up + Volume Down, 3 s.** One `getevent -lq` reader per key device (on this phone Volume Up is on `gpio-keys`, Volume Down on the PMIC's `pmic_resin`). When both are down, a timer looks at the two keys every 0.25 s for 3 s; a release of 0.5 s or more ends the hold, a shorter one does not (the S24 Ultra's two keys are one rocker, and pressing both ends chatters) | always, unless a program grabs the key device |
| 2 | The same chord from the keys' **state**: `getevent -pl` asks each device twice a second (EVIOCGKEY; a key that is down is marked `*`); seven samples with both down, one sample without them in between allowed | also when a program has grabbed the keys: a grab takes the events from other readers, not the state |
| 3 | **The watcher**: returns on `session/return.request`, when xnuhost ends, when the switch never started it (60 s), when the guest never reported `ready` (600 s) | iOS crashed, never started, or asked to leave |
| 4 | The key readers start the return themselves if the session is still not returning 5 s after their request | the watcher is gone or stuck |
| 5 | **The return's guard**: a process of its own that reboots the phone if a step of the return has not finished within its own limit (75 s for Gate B; above), or the whole return after 600 s; the watcher reboots at once if the return script cannot run or ends with an error | a step of the return hangs or the script is damaged |
| 6 | **The failsafe reboot** on any failed check of the return | anything about One UI's state is in doubt |
| 7 | **Power + Volume Down, held until the phone restarts (about 7 s)** | always |

**What the guest cannot do to 1 to 6.** The watcher, the readers and the poll are One UI-side processes: started
before xnuhost exists, in init's mount namespace, each its own session, in the root cgroup (which cannot be
frozen and is not xnuhost's), `oom_score_adj` -1000, at a higher priority than ordinary processes, and they run
on One UI's kernel, not on anything the guest schedules. A guest that hangs, spins on every core or runs out of
memory does not stop them. What they read is in `control/`, which xnuhost's namespace has read-only: a guest
that empties its `session/` folder is still returned from. The watcher keeps the wakelock up every 10 s.
What xnuhost must not do, by its contract on OneiOS's board (`docs/agents.md`, "booter -> oneos"): grab an input
device, run its threads in a realtime scheduling class (on every core that would leave the way back 5 % of
the CPU), leave its cgroup or mount namespace, or write to `/sys/power`. Path 2 covers a grab all the same.

**The display and the GPU.** xnuhost draws the guest with the Adreno (KGSL) and, in a session without One UI's
compositor, on the panel itself (DRM). The kernel takes all of that back when the process ends, however it
ends: its KGSL contexts and memory are freed and its DRM master and framebuffers are dropped on SIGKILL exactly
as on a clean exit, so nothing has to be released by xnuhost. What can be left is on One UI's side (a composer
that last saw another DRM master, a surfaceflinger whose GPU context a guest fault reset or that is stuck in a
call), which is why the return never trusts the old display state: it always restarts the composer and
surfaceflinger and requires both back. A GPU that does not recover fails those checks, or Gate C, and ends in
the reboot. A process the kernel cannot end (stuck in a driver) fails Gate A: reboot.

Not ported from OneOS's return: holding the composer (`oneos_boot_hold_display`). It keeps the return splash's
last frame on the panel while no surfaceflinger exists; an iOS session's boot screen is ended before the gates
("Boot screen", above), and the composer's client here is One UI's own surfaceflinger, which a stopped composer
would only block. So from the end of the return's first step to One UI's boot animation the screen is black.

**The hardware restart (7).** Holding the Side (Power) key and Volume Down together for about 7 seconds is the
phone's forced restart. It is done by the PMIC, below Android's kernel and everything in this session: the two
keys are the PMIC's own inputs on this phone (`pmic_pwrkey`, `pmic_resin`), the reset is set up once at boot,
and neither a grab of the keys, a hung kernel nor anything this session runs changes it (the scripts and
xnuhost never touch the PMIC's reset settings). **It always lands in One UI**, because a session
changes nothing that survives a restart: nothing is flashed, no partition of One UI's is written, no persist
property is set, SELinux's mode is not changed, and the reboot the scripts ask for names a reason
(`oneios-return`, `oneios-inplace-failsafe`) that the bootloader takes as an ordinary restart. The session
lives in processes, a mount namespace, a cgroup and two kernel wakelocks, and all of them end with the kernel.
The files it leaves are under the stage; the next switch clears `session/` and `control/`.

This is true by construction and is Samsung's documented forced restart for this phone; it has **not been
pressed during an iOS session**, because no session has run (below). On the first run over adb: start a
session, hold the two keys, and check that One UI boots and `oneios_root.sh status` reports no open session.

**From inside a working iOS.** xnuhost's host call `XH_HALT_RETURN` writes `session/return.request` and exits,
which is a return (3). What calls it from iOS (a Settings row, an AssistiveTouch action) is OneiOS's userland's
to add and is not needed for any of the above. The OneOS app's own *Back to One UI* does not go through
`return.request`: it runs `oneios_return.sh` directly (root's `return` verb), so it works without a watcher;
the two meet at the return's lock.

## One UI's data guards

- xnuhost and every iOS process run in a mount namespace where `/data` is the stage. One UI's app data,
  `/data/system`, `/data/misc` (keystore, gatekeeper, lock-screen files) do not exist there, and the session
  aborts if they do.
- The session scripts and the root script write only under the stage. They never call setenforce, never set a
  `persist.*` property, never talk to vold, keystore2, gatekeeper, weaver or locksettings, and mount nothing in
  init's namespace. `OneiosScriptTest` checks this on their text. The return unmounts nothing either: a
  namespace that still had the stage as its `/data` would see One UI's `/data` in its place, so its processes
  are ended instead, and what cannot be ended is a reboot.
- The Android guests' guard jars are not involved: an iOS guest has no binder client.

## Tests and build

- `core/model` `OneiosTest`: the S24 Ultra-only gating and the tick; manifest parsing (format version, paths,
  sizes, hashes, a runtime without xnuhost); verification against a manifest; unpacking a tar with the manifest
  first, last or under a top folder; damaged, padded and truncated packages; the release JSON and `.sha256` file.
- `core/root` `OneiosScriptTest`: the launcher, `oneios_root.sh` and `oneios_switch.sh`'s stage checks run under
  the machine's shells against a fake root (`ONEIOS_TEST_ROOT`; the scripts refuse it as uid 0 and start nothing
  there): the refusal without a runtime, a runtime without xnuhost, changed files, mismatched pairs; and the
  guards on the scripts' text.
- The same class runs **the way back** against a fake phone: the key readers, the poll, the watcher and
  `oneios_return.sh` themselves, with stand-ins for Android's tools
  (`core/root/src/test/resources/oneios/phone-tools.sh`), processes as folders, and a clock that runs faster.
  No real process is signalled. Covered: the chord on two devices, a chattering hold (a short lift about once a second
  through the hold: the rule before 2026-11-12, no release at all for 3 s, never returned there), a long release, a short hold, one key, auto-repeat, an old
  session's reader, the poll with no event at all, the keys starting the return without a watcher; the watcher
  on xnuhost's end, on a request, on a missing `ready`, with a wiped `session/` folder, and with a return
  script that cannot run; the return in place after SIGTERM and after SIGKILL of tasks in other namespaces,
  with a surfaceflinger that died or outlived the composer; and a reboot for each failed check (a process that
  cannot be killed, a stage mount left anywhere, a mount on One UI's partitions, another vold, another SELinux
  mode, another boot, a zygote that started by itself, a composer, surfaceflinger or audioserver that does not
  come back, no system_server, a user that never unlocks), for a return that hangs (the guard) and for a
  return whose lock holder is gone. These are the scripts' logic, not the phone: `getevent`'s `*` mark, cgroup
  v2, the composer restart and the forced restart are still to be seen on the S24 Ultra.
- **What the phone found** (0.4.81). `OneiosScriptTest`, under each shell: no script redirects `:`, and the
  inner shell's read-only check goes on when the write fails; the trace's last line names the status and the
  step; the inner shell's step lines come before each command of the setup, and the switch waits by its pid;
  with a `tr` that never ends on an unreadable input (as toybox's), a stop loop and an inner shell whose cmdline
  cannot be read do not stall the return, and no script lets `tr` read a `/proc` file itself; an inner shell
  still setting up is ended by its pid; a composer restart that never comes back is a reboot at Gate B's limit
  with the step named, and the limits (90, 45, 75, 45, 290 s) stay under the guard's 600 s. Not in the unit tests, run by
  hand on the PC: the inner shell itself under mksh in a user and mount namespace (`unshare -Urm`, a stand-in
  root with the stage, `chroot`): 0.4.79's script ends there as on the phone (status 1, an empty log,
  `control/busybox` copied, no pid); 0.4.81's traces its fifteen steps and execs the runtime's xnuhost with the
  stage as `/data`.
- **The boot screen.** `OneiosScriptTest`, under each shell: root stages the three files in `bin/` and takes no
  other name; `boot_status.sh`'s `oneos_boot_begin ios` writes the title, the hint and the icon, and its
  supervisor in the `ios` mode starts the renderer with the bound, reads no Android boot event and ends on the
  stop flag; the feeder shows each stage from real log lines (one after a megabyte of console), keeps the
  furthest, starts again at a restart in place, shows a panic as printable ASCII and then why xnuhost ended,
  signals nothing and asks nothing of init; the hand-off at the helper's first frame and at `ready` with its
  layer up, and no hand-off for `ready` alone, a helper without a frame, or a stale pid; a renderer that never
  drew is given up; the return ends the screen before Gate A in place, on a failsafe, on the reboot return, for
  a switch that never stopped One UI and from the watcher (with the reason on the screen); a renderer that
  cannot be killed or a stale pid file is logged and One UI still comes back in place; and on the scripts' text:
  it starts after the way back is armed, has no key device, property, signal or reboot in it, and its end cannot
  fail the return. `scripts/test-boot-status.py` and `test-guest-restart-splash.py` (the Android guests' use of
  the same script) pass unchanged. Not covered by any test: the renderer itself (`app_process` and
  surfaceflinger exist only on the phone), so the layout with the hint has not been seen.
- **Hardware checks.** `core/model` `OneiosChecksTest`: the reading of each tool's output (bridgectl's five
  commands, gpuctl, displayctl, brightctl's three, camctl's list and capture with every failure line of its
  README), a missing tool, a tool ended at its limit, root's result lines, the shared text. `OneiosScriptTest`,
  with shell scripts standing in for the tools in a staged runtime: the script's table is the app's (tool,
  arguments, limit per id); a check passes the table's arguments and returns output and exit code; a missing
  tool; a changed tool is not run; no check during a session; the camera's picture comes back intact; **a hung
  tool is ended at the limit, also one that ignores SIGTERM, and the backlight and the sensor are put back**;
  `uncheck` alone puts back once and takes only plain names and numbers from its saved files; the guards on the
  script's text. Not covered by any test: the screen itself, and every tool on the phone.
- **Session logs.** `core/model` `OneiosLogsTest`: the summary of a boot that panics after SpringBoard, of an early
  panic, of a ready session ended by the return's SIGTERM with the watcher's reason from `return.log`; every way a
  session ends; a guest restart in place; the chips and the search; root's list and chunk lines; the returns in
  `return.log` and which one belongs to a log. `OneiosScriptTest`: `logs` lists this session's log, the five newest
  earlier ones and the others with sizes, times and last lines; a 6,000-line log read back in chunks of whole
  lines is the file; a last line with no line break; the 1 MiB limit and the ids, in the launcher and in the script
  itself; a symlink, a hard link or a linked folder in place of a log is never read; nothing in the stage changes;
  the two verbs' text has no write and a time limit on every read; the return's own log, written by the real
  scripts on the fake phone, gives the summary's "Return:" line. `ReadOnlyListsTest`: `logs.oneios` passes the
  read-only audit and names only the log files. Not covered by any test: the two screens.
- **The import.** `core/model` `TransferTest`: the screen hears of the bytes at most four times a second however
  often they are counted, the speed and the time left; reading ahead gives the same bytes in any read size, hands
  an error of its source over where it happened and lets only its own thread close the source; the copy that
  hashes beside the write. `OneiosTest`: a manifest that is the first file is read in the same pass as the files,
  one that is not is found by going on. `core/root` `OneiosImportTest` runs `OneiosImport` through `RootShell`
  (a shell in `su`'s place) against the root script and a fake root, from `.tar.zst` packages made in the test:
  one pass and one opening of the file when the manifest is first, two when it is not; root refusing a file
  whose SHA-256 is not the manifest's with the app's own hash off, and what was staged before left as it was;
  a link, an unlisted file, a cut-off archive, a file that is not a package, a missing file; a large file
  checked by root while the next is sent, and its refusal ending the import; Stop. `OneiosScriptTest`:
  `receive` with three kinds of `dd` (GNU's, a stand-in that refuses `fullblock` like toybox's, one that takes no
  `iflag`) takes a file of several pipe buffers whole, takes no more than it was told, and refuses a short file
  and a wrong SHA-256. Not covered by any test: toybox's own `dd`, the screen, the service and the wakelock.
- `./gradlew :core:model:test :core:root:testDebugUnitTest`. The app itself needs the SESL9 libraries from
  GitHub Packages (a token in `~/.config/twidget/github.properties`), as before this change.

## CI: the APK without a personal token

`.github/workflows/oneios-apk.yml`, on every push to `oneios` and by hand (`gh workflow run oneios-apk.yml -R
akshaynexus/OneOS --ref oneios`):

1. Reads tribalfs' SESL9 and oneui-design packages with the run's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`permissions: packages:
   read`), passed as `GH_PACKAGES_USER` / `GH_PACKAGES_TOKEN`, which `settings.gradle.kts` already takes. The first
   step tries it on one file and prints GitHub's answer; if that is a refusal, it uses the optional repository
   secret `GH_PACKAGES_TOKEN` (a token with `read:packages`) and says which one it used.
2. Builds the in-guest app (`scripts/build-guest-manager.sh --debug`), runs the unit tests, and builds the normal
   full edition: `:app:assembleFullDebug` with the default `oneos.packSets` (unset). That packs no package set:
   the build records each set file's size and download source from `packages/remote.txt` and `sizes.txt`, and the
   app downloads them by SHA-256. So upstream's `out/overlays*` folders are not needed, and the APK holds no OEM
   file and no image.
3. Uploads `OneOS-oneios-<version>-debug.apk` as an artifact and attaches it to the prerelease `oneios-<version>`
   on the fork, recreated at the built commit each time.

Each run signs with a debug key of its own unless the secret `ONEIOS_DEBUG_KEYSTORE_B64` (a base64 debug keystore)
is set, so without it an earlier build has to be uninstalled before a new one installs. The in-guest app is a
debug build too: Android guests that already hold upstream's release-signed one cannot take it as an update.

## Not done yet

- **The boot screen has not run on the phone** (0.4.80). Unknown until it does: whether `app_process` starts
  the renderer from the iOS stage's `bin/` (the Android guests run it from their own stage, which is tested on
  the Fold8); whether One UI's surfaceflinger keeps showing the layer once system_server is gone (OneOS's
  Verbose boot relies on the same); how the hint and a long reason look on the S24 Ultra's panel. OneiOS's
  `oneos/interface.md` section 8 should name the lines this reads beyond the nine stages: the console's
  `OneiOS Data: first start` and `OneiOS Data: unpacking the seed`, and the display helper's
  `oneios-display: first frame posted`, `oneios-display: layer up` and
  `oneios-display: display projection set to the active mode`.
- **Session logs have not run on the phone.** The two screens were compiled, never opened on a device; the root
  verbs and the parser ran under bash and mksh on the PC against fake stages and OneiOS's PC boot logs. A phone
  session's log may have lines the PC's never had: the summary names only what it finds.
- **Hardware checks have not run on the phone.** Unknown until they do: whether KernelSU's `su` from the app gives
  the tools what adb's root shell gives them (SELinux context, mount namespace); whether `displayctl`'s helper
  starts from the stage (`app_process` with a dex under `/data/local/tmp/oneios/runtime/lib`); whether `pkill -f`
  on this build matches as the put-back step expects; whether the app reads Bluetooth's and adaptive brightness's
  state on One UI 8 without a permission (if not, it reads "off" and the row runs). The screen's layout was
  compiled, not seen.

- **xnuhost has not started on the phone yet** (see "What the first runs on the phone found"). The switch
  starts whatever the runtime package names, by the contract above;
  the booter's own interface on OneiOS's board (`docs/agents.md`) replaces that command line if it differs.
- Nothing past the preflight has run on a phone: the zygote stop without a guest framework, the watchdog feeder,
  the wakelock, and the in-place return are written from OneOS's Android session and need their first run over
  adb with the owner watching. For the way back, that run should check, in this order: `getevent -pl
  /dev/input/event0` with Volume Up held shows `KEY_VOLUMEUP*`; `/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers` exists; a
  session returns on the chord; it returns with `kill -9` of xnuhost and with `kill -STOP` of it (the keys
  still work); the composer restart brings One UI's display back; Power + Volume Down restarts into One UI.
- Left undone in the way back (2026-11-10): no return splash after the boot screen ends, so nothing like OneOS's composer hold; no
  "Back to One UI" inside iOS (xnuhost's `XH_HALT_RETURN` is there, nothing in the guest calls it); the watcher
  does not restart a key reader that died (the poll and the other readers cover it); the Bluetooth, camera and
  vibrator HALs are not restarted at the return (OneiOS's bridges are to name the ones that need it); the CI
  step that installs mksh for the script tests has not run yet.
- The display helper xnuhost asks for (a root SurfaceControl layer that shows the frames of
  `session/display.sock`) is not written. When it is, it belongs to the session: started after xnuhost, in its
  cgroup, so that the return ends it with the rest.
- No return splash for iOS (the boot screen ends before the return's gates), no Quick switch.
- Wi-Fi: One UI's supplicant leaves with its framework. Networking in the guest is xnuhost's to solve.
- The image format follows `oneos/interface.md` until OneiOS's `docs/image-format.md` is written.
- The app update, release scripts and the Probe edition know nothing of iOS.
