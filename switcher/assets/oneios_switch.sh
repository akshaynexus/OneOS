# The OneiOS session: One UI's framework stops and xnuhost (XNU as a process,
# from the OneiOS runtime package) starts with the staged iOS image set.
# docs/oneios.md; the contract with xnuhost is OneiOS's oneos/interface.md
# (session ABI 1). Modelled on oneos_switch.sh: every refusal comes before the
# first change, One UI's zygote is stopped and kept stopped, and the way back
# (oneios_return.sh: in place, else a reboot) is armed before the stop.
#
#   oneios_switch.sh            the session (preflight, stop, start xnuhost)
#   oneios_switch.sh --check    the preflight only; changes nothing
#   oneios_switch.sh --inner    (internal) inside the session's mount namespace
#   oneios_switch.sh --watch    (internal) the watcher that returns to One UI
#   oneios_switch.sh --keys D TOK        (internal) Volume Up + Volume Down, from device D's events
#   oneios_switch.sh --keys-poll TOK D.. (internal) the same chord from the keys' state (works under a grab)
#   oneios_switch.sh --feed     (internal) Samsung's software watchdog feeder
#   oneios_switch.sh --stop-loop (internal) keeps One UI's zygote stopped
#   oneios_switch.sh --bootui   (internal) the boot screen's stage line, from xnuhost's log
#
# What a session never touches: One UI's /data beyond $STAGE (xnuhost's mount
# namespace has the stage bound over /data), vold, keystore2, gatekeeper,
# weaver, the lock-screen files, SELinux's mode, persist.* properties.
# What it changes, all undone by oneios_return.sh or a reboot: One UI's zygote
# (and zygote_secondary) stopped, the kernel wakelock oneios_session, Samsung's
# software watchdog closed and fed, the cgroup oneios_session (xnuhost's own),
# OneOS's boot screen on a surfaceflinger layer until the guest's first frame.
#
# The ways back to One UI, none of which needs anything from the guest
# (docs/oneios.md, "Getting back to One UI"):
#   1  Volume Up + Volume Down held 3 s: one reader per key device (--keys) and
#      a poll of the keys' state (--keys-poll) that a grab cannot starve.
#   2  the watcher (--watch): on a request, when xnuhost ends, when the guest
#      never reports ready. If it does not act on the keys, the key readers
#      start the return themselves.
#   3  oneios_return.sh: in place, a reboot on any doubt, and a reboot by its
#      own guard if it does not finish.
#   4  Power + Volume Down held: the phone's own forced restart, below all of this.

# Tests (OneiosScriptTest) set ONEIOS_TEST_ROOT to a folder that stands for /:
# then only the stage checks run, never as root, and no session is started.
# The watcher and the key readers (--watch, --keys, --keys-poll) can be run
# there by themselves: against that folder's proc, sys and stage, with its
# bin/ first on PATH (stand-ins for getevent, getprop, setprop, ...), and with
# its bin/kill and bin/sleep in place of the shell's, so a test never signals

# --- ONE UI'S CLOCK CAPS ----------------------------------------------------
# One UI (Samsung's SSRM in system_server, and the HALs it drives) caps the CPU and
# GPU clocks when the phone is warm, and its power HAL raises the CPUs' floors in
# bursts. The switch stops system_server, so whatever it last wrote stayed for the
# whole session: 1.7-2.0 GHz CPUs and a 500 MHz GPU after a warm One UI (the S24
# Ultra, 2026-11-12; OneiOS docs/hardware.md 7d). These nodes are saved while One
# UI is whole (clocks_save, into control/base/clocks: node, One UI's value, the
# session's) and the hardware's range is written once system_server is gone
# (clocks_tops); the return writes One UI's values back before its zygote starts,
# on every path that stopped One UI, a killed xnuhost's too. The kernel's thermal
# zones, trips and cooling devices are never written: they, LMh and xnuhost's own
# thermal step (OneiOS runtime/bridges/thermal) cap the session. Nothing under
# /sys/power.
