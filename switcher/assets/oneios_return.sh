#   oneios_return.sh reboot     straight to the reboot
#   oneios_return.sh --guard T  (internal) this return's own dead-man timer
#
# In place (the structure of return_to_oneui.sh, docs/inplace-return.md,
# shorter: an iOS session mounts nothing in init's namespace, changes no
# property and never talks to One UI's services):
#   1  stop the session: SIGTERM to xnuhost, 20 s, then SIGKILL to everything
#      in its cgroup and its mount namespace; the key readers and the watcher end.
#   A  nothing of the session is left: no process in its namespace or cgroup,
#      the stage mounted in no process's mount table, the same boot, vold,
#      keystore2 and servicemanager with the pids of the switch, SELinux as it
#      was.
#   B  the stop loop is gone; One UI's boot counters are back; the display is
#      One UI's again (the composer and surfaceflinger restarted, the boot
#      animation); audioserver and the rest of zygote's restart list; the
#      services One UI's framework waits for are registered; zygote starts.
#   C  system_server keeps its pid until user 0 is unlocked and 20 s more.
# Never ":" with a redirection in this script or in oneios_switch.sh: ":" is a
# special builtin, and Android's sh (mksh) ends the whole script, without a
# word, when its redirection fails. "true" is not one.
# Any failed check ends in failsafe(): a reboot, which is always a correct way
# back (nothing of the session survives one, and nothing of One UI's was
# written). A return that does not finish is rebooted by its guard.

# Tests (OneiosScriptTest) set ONEIOS_TEST_ROOT to a folder that stands for /:
# its proc, sys, stage and root tools, its bin/ first on PATH, its bin/kill
# and bin/sleep in place of the shell's, so a test never signals a real
# process, and its bin/now as the clock (a test's seconds are shorter). Never
# as root; on a phone the variable is dropped instead, because this script
