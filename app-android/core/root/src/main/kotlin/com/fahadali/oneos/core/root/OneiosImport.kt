/**
 * The import of a OneiOS package (a runtime package or the iOS image set) into
 * the stage, over the same road as an Android system's image: the app unpacks
 * and streams, [RootShell] carries each file to the root script's `receive`,
 * root checks its size and SHA-256 and only `finish` puts anything in place
 * (docs/oneios.md, "Importing either package").
 *
 * One pass over the archive when its manifest is the first file, which is how
 * OneiOS packs both packages; otherwise a pass for the manifest and one to
 * unpack. Three threads share the work of a file: one reads ahead (under it the
 * caller's decompressor), one writes to root's stdin, one hashes the buffer
 * being written. Root's check of a large file, for which it reads the file
 * again, runs while the next file is sent. Here, in :core:root, so the tests run it whole against the
 * root script and a fake root.
