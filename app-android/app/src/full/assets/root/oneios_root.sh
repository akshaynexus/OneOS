# OneiOS root script: every change the OneOS app makes as root for the iOS 27
# (OneiOS) system is one of the verbs below, and nothing else (docs/oneios.md).
#
# Like oneos_root.sh, the app never runs this file from its own storage. Its
# launcher (OneiosRoot.kt, a fixed text) runs only $STAGE/bin/oneios_root.sh,
# root's and writable by root only, and only with the SHA-256 pinned in the
# app's BuildConfig; status, begin and remove may first install it there.
# Arguments are fixed words, decimal numbers, lowercase hex and plain relative
# paths only.
#
#   status                      read only: what is staged, the session, whether
#                               a switch would start (oneios_switch.sh --check)
#   begin <runtime|image>       start staging one of them into <kind>.new
#   receive <runtime|image> <path> <bytes> <sha256> <mode>
